Charmed Valkey is an open-source **Juju charm** that will automate the deployment, scaling,
configuration and operations of [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) clusters across clouds,
virtual machines and bare metal, using the [Juju](https://juju.is/) orchestration framework.

[Valkey](https://valkey.io/) is a community-driven, open-source, high-performance
key-value data store compatible with Redis® clients and ecosystem tooling.

The charm aims to simplify Valkey operations from
[Day 0 to Day 2](https://codilime.com/blog/day-0-day-1-day-2-the-software-lifecycle-in-the-cloud-age/),
offering secure defaults
integration interfaces, and lifecycle automation.
