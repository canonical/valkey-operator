"""Integration tests for S3 restore against MicroCeph.

Scenarios:
  1. rollback          – write → backup → mutate → restore → original value back on all units.
  2. disaster-recovery – write → backup → remove app → redeploy → restore → data back.
  3. corrupt-restore   – attempt restore of a corrupt S3 object → old data preserved →
                         Sentinel failover still works (suppression-leak regression guard).
  4. leader ≠ primary  – a failed restore on a non-leader primary must not wedge the cluster.
  5. single unit       – happy path on a 1-unit app: no replicas, no resync, leader == primary.

Run only with a bootstrapped Juju controller and built charm:
    tox run -e integration -- tests/integration/backup/test_s3_restore.py --substrate k8s
